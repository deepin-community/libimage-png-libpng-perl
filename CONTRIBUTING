Thank you for your interest in contributing.

If you would like to contribute to Image::PNG::Libpng, the first thing
to do is to either email me or add an issue at the github. Because I
started off making this to be distributed by CPAN, the github
repository doesn't contain all of the scripts used to build the
module, so forking there will probably end up annoying you.

Although the module does most of the big parts of libpng, there is a
lot of detailed work on this module remaining to be done, such as the
handling of unknown chunks. Please be warned that the underlying
library, "libpng", has a lot of "quirks" in its implementation and
documentation, so an inevitable part of contributing to this module
will be your having to root through the libpng C source code.
